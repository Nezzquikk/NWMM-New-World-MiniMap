* Live visualisation of player position on MiniMap
* Circular & rectangular Map
* Configurable

# How to use:

* Bad OCR in daylight

INFO: It may be possible that one or the other library I use in this project is not compatible with newest version of Python
I recommend using Python 3.8 (I myself use Python 3.8.8)
